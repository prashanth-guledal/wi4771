## Prerequisites
The PCs in the computer room DW-PC1 running under SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 
12 SP1 are equipped with all software necessary for this course. If you prefer 
using your private laptop please make sure that you have installed all necessary
software. **Please note that we cannot give any kind of support for installing
software on private laptops. In this case you are on your own.**

### Git
The version control system Git is available by the `git` command. If you work on
your own PC please install Git as explained on the website https://git-scm.com.

### CMake
The build system CMake is available by the `cmake` command. If you work on
your own PC please install CMake (version 3.1 or better) as explained on the
website https://cmake.org.

### C++ compiler
The GNU C++ Compiler 5.1 is available by the `g++` command. If you work on
your own PC please install a C++ compiler that has full C++11 support. Compilers
that are known to work are GNU C++ 5.x or 6.x (https://gcc.gnu.org), Xcode on 
macOS (available via the AppStore), and Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition
(available for free via https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).


## Getting started

1. Fetch the repository
   ```
   git clone https://gitlab.com/mmoelle1/wi4771tu.2017
   ```
   or use a Git GUI under Windows to obtain the lecture slides, example programs
   and homework assignments.
   
2. On the PCs in DW-PC1 load the necessary compilers by running
   ```
   source $HOME/wi4771tu.2017/tudelft.bashrc
   ```
   In order to execute this command each time you login to the PC run
   ```
   echo "source $HOME/wi4771tu.2017/tudelft.bashrc" >> .bashrc
   ```
   
3. Create a `build` directory and run CMake
   ```
   cd wi4771tu.2017
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```
   This will generate all required Makefiles needed to compile the examples.
   If you work on your private laptop and have different compilers installed it
   might be necessary to specify the one you intend to use explicitly by running
   ```
   CC=gcc-5 CXX=g++-5 cmake ..
   ```
   On **Windows**, the CMake GUI will detect installed C++ compilers automatically 
   and suggest possible targets. The easiest way is to generate a Visual Studio
   Project which can be directly loaded into the Microsoft IDE.
   On **macOS**, CMake can generate project files that can be loaded into Xcode
   ```
   cmake -G Xcode ..
   ```
   
4. Compile the examples
   ```
   make
   ```
   If you work on **Windows** with Microsoft Visual Studio or **macOS** with
   Xcode open the project file and compile the examples from within the IDE.
